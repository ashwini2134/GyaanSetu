  {
    question: "How do I get access to GyanSetu?",
    answer: "GyanSetu is offered through partner institutions and organizations. If your school or company already works with GyanSetu, you can sign up directly. Otherwise, reach out and we'll help you get set up."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need prior coding experience?",
    answer: "Not for our Python course. It is designed to take you from zero to intermediate. However, our Artificial Intelligence course assumes you have basic programming knowledge (like variables, loops, and functions)."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI Code Review work?",
    answer: "When you submit a project via GitHub, our backend pulls your code and runs a semantic analysis using a combination of static analysis tools and LLMs (like Claude/Gemini). It checks for logic errors, best practices, and efficiency, giving you line-by-line feedback within seconds."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I get a certificate?",
    answer: "Yes! Upon successfully completing a course and passing all project reviews, you'll receive a verifiable, cryptographic certificate. You can link this certificate on LinkedIn or your resume, and employers can verify its authenticity instantly."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from a typical bootcamp?",
    answer: "Traditional bootcamps cost thousands and rely heavily on manual grading, which slows you down. GyanSetu uses an automated, AI-driven infrastructure to give you instant feedback, letting you move at your own pace while building a real, verifiable portfolio."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my code and account data private?",
    answer: "Yes. Your account data and progress are stored securely, and we don't run third-party advertising or tracking scripts on the platform. Code you submit for a project is sent to a third-party AI provider (currently Google Gemini) purely to generate review feedback — we don't sell your data, and your portfolio stays private unless you choose to make it public. See our Privacy Policy for the full detail."
