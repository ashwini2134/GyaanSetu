        <h2>What we actually use</h2>
        <p>
          GyanSetu uses a small, fixed set of cookies and browser-storage items to keep you signed in and
          the app working. We don't use advertising, tracking, or analytics cookies — there's currently no
          third-party tracking script on this platform to disclose.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          {COOKIES.map((c) => (
            <div key={c.name} className="rounded-xl border border-[var(--border-primary)] bg-[var(--bg-surface)] p-5">

        <h2>Browser storage (not cookies, but similar in spirit)</h2>
        <p>
          We also use your browser's local storage for a couple of items. These aren't cookies — they're not sent
          to any server automatically — but we're listing them here for full transparency:
        </p>
        <ul>
          {LOCAL_STORAGE.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.name}>
              <strong>{item.name}</strong> — {item.purpose}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <p>All of this is cleared automatically when you sign out.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Because it's all strictly necessary</h2>
        <p>
          Every item above is required for the platform to function — signing in, staying signed in, and keeping
          your session secure. There's nothing here you can selectively opt out of via a cookie banner, because
          there's nothing optional to opt out of; that's also why we haven't put a cookie-consent banner in front
          of the site.
